Paraman is a Clojure library for converting Clojure maps into valid HTTP query
params. It supports arrays and nested objects.

I saw the need for such a library because I found out both clj-http and
http-kit clients do not fully support both arrays, nested objects or arrays
consisting of objects, which some API require (For example, Stripe API).

## Usage

Instead of passing your params map to either clj-http or http-kit :form-params
request option, use the library to convert your params into a valid HTTP query string and
pass it directly to the request :body of either your clj-http or http-kit
request options. 
Instead of:

```clojure
(require '[org.httpkit.client :as http])
(def my-post-data {:some [{:obj "key1"} {:obj "key2"}]})
@(http/post "http://some.url.com/resource" {:form-params my-post-data})
; =>  java.lang.ClassCastException: clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap cannot be cast to clojure.lang.Named
```

Do:

```clojure
(require '[org.httpkit.client :as http])
(require '[paraman.core :refer [convert]])
(def my-post-data {:some [{:obj "key1"} {:obj "key2"}]})
@(http/post "http://some.url.com/resource" {:body (convert my-post-data)})
```

And you're good to go. Your map will be converted to valid HTTP encoded form params.
